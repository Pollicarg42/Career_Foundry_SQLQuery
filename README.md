# Career_Foundry_SQLQuery
SQL Queries from Career Foundry Exercise 5 

This SQL repository contains SQL queries created during my Career Foundry Data Analyst Course. 

This contains queries made to complete the Rockbuster Project. 
This project aimed to showcase my ability to query data using many SQL tools such as Filtering, Summarizing, Cleaning, Joining and Performing Subqueries.
Included here is a Data Dictionary that I created based on data sourced from Career Foundry's Rockbuster data. 
It will also include a powerpoint presentation showcasing my findings, visualizations, and data insights from my analysis. 
SQL Queries are copied and placed in the Excel file.
