# Career_Foundry_SQL_Project
SQL Queries from Career Foundry Exercise 5 

This SQL repository contains SQL queries created during my Career Foundry Data Analyst Course. 

## Project Description:
This contains queries made to complete the Rockbuster Project. 
This project aimed to showcase my ability to query data using many SQL tools such as Filtering, Summarizing, Cleaning, Joining and Performing Subqueries.
SQL code was performed using PostgreSQL as the RDBMS.
Included here is a Data Dictionary that I created based on data sourced from Career Foundry's Rockbuster data. 
It will also include a powerpoint presentation showcasing my findings, visualizations, and data insights from my analysis. 
SQL Queries are copied and placed in the Excel file. 

## Rockbuster Project:
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company planning to launch an online video rental service. As the data analyst for this project, I worked with the 
Business Intelligence department in analyzing inventory, developing customer insight, and perform data-related queries. I used PostgreSQL as my RDBMS, and I 
wrote SQL queries to analyze data and answer business questions for Rockbuster departments. 

## Skills Gained from this Project:
- Database Querying, Summarizing, and Cleaning Data in SQL
- Filtering and Presenting Data with SQL operations (Select, Where, Order by, etc.)
- Joining Databases (Left, Right, Inner Joins etc.)
- Subquerying and using Common Table Expressions
