-- Here is an example of a Common Table Expression code written for the RockBuster Project

-- I used this code to gather insight on the top 5 payments of the top 5 customers
-- using the Rockbuster relational database. This code is similar to that used in the other sql example
-- only that it uses CTEs to simplify the query. 

-- Here is a link to the relational database schema for the datasets used in this example:
