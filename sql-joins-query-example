-- This code was written as part of the Rockbuster Project

-- It was used to gather insight on the top 10 countries that are home to the top customers according 
--   to Rockbuster's sales data. 

-- This code includes multiple join clauses used to combine datasets based on their attribute relationships
-- It also uses many SQL operations and data manipulation language to get the effective results. 

-- Here is a link to the relational database model for the datasets used in this query:
